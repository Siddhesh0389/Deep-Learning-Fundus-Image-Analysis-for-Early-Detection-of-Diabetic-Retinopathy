# Deep-Learning-Fundus-Image-Analysis-for-Early-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy
This project develops a Deep Learning-based system to detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images using the Xception CNN model. It classifies images into five severity levels and is integrated with a Flask web application where users can upload images and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores.
